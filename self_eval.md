# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
I feel fairly good about this process. I think once I get to memorizing more of these, I can do faster. I spent a long time trying to find a list of them and playing around with it on replit.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
I feel good about writing my own methods. I'll just practice more during the break
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
How do you undo a method with the "!" at the end? Is it possible?
